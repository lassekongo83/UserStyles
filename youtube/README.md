Various fixes for things that annoys me on YouTube.

### YouTube oldish layout
An old userstyle that's no longer updated. This UserStyle was converted from my extension [YouTube Classic Polymer](https://github.com/lassekongo83/yt-classic-polymer). (Which is also no longer updated.)

### How to subscribe
1. Go to uBlock Origin's settings and click on the `Filter lists` pane.
2. Scroll to the bottom and check the `import` checkbox.
3. Copy and paste [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lassekongo83/UserStyles/master/youtube/yt-oldish-layout.txt) in the text area and then save the changes.
4. Reload YouTube.
